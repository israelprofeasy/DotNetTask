# Program Design and Flow

Program design is a .net 8 web API application.

DTOs (Data transfer object) where created to interface with client application, which will then be mapped to the models created to fit into the database structure

CRUD operations which include create, read(get), update and delete where created to enable client access, store and manipulate data to and from the database

CosmosDB for NoSQL was used which is schema agnostic, and suited for saving json object as a document

Unit test was writing with XUnit to ensure code reliability
